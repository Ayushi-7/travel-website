Innovative Idea:
Our Idea is based on a travel website. The main concept is that people would be able to share their experiences of locations, from popular places known today to the hidden gems in lesser known areas. Users can create their own profile and share such locations through a post including pictures of their experiences as well as a review of their time there. Other users may then rate the post and add their own comment. Users may look up a location and find all the interesting and popular posts taken within that area and may benefit from the search sub category, which will include types of locations, from scenic, adventure, historic, people/party etc.

Other travel websites are mostly based on trip planners, flight scheduling or travel blogs. Our concept is slightly related to travel bogs but it is more than just that. Rather than opening up a website to just see reviews of places, we have given users the ability to chime in with their own reviews and share their experiences, making it a more collaborative and interactive platform.

Data: 
The Data Types we are going to use in our project are the following:
1) User Profile - Users will be able to create an account if they are a first time user and login/logout of the application. Each profile will contain information such as name, profile picture and/or a bio. Having a User Profile will help create a more personalized and interactive experience for a user.

2) Photos - This will be used for users to upload and share with other users photos from their travel. The photos will be useful to help people discover new places they would want to travel to and learn about places they may not have heard of before.

3) Locations and Places- This will have information about each travel place such as the name, location and description of the place. Users can also post about popular attractions and restaurants at the place they travelled to if they wish to do so.

4) Ratings - This will be used for users to rate their experiences at a certain place on a 5 star scale. Ratings will help people identify potential places they would want to travel to next based on how high/low it is. 

5) Comments - This will allow users to comment on the posts of other users. It will also be a place for users to share any tips/recommendations they have about travelling to a place. It will allow people of similar interests to interact and share their experiences in travelling to a place. 

Functionality:
1) All users need to make a profile and login to see the website. They can use this profile to view, like and comment on the other travel posts. 

2) People can post their experiences, images, tips and recommendations for any place that they have visited. 

3) Users can rate other people's posts based on their experience and how helpful/relevant they found it. Users can rate their experience of the location on a 5 star system and this could also be used as a sorting method for any place.

4) Users can add comments to posts written by other users. This would be useful if a user wants to share their own experiences or add more details to an existing post.

5) The website would be organized by location, where users can pick a location and see a list of posts and comments related to that location.
